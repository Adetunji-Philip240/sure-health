                Begin a guided assessment to help identify potential health
                conditions based on the symptoms you are experiencing. Our
                intelligent system analyzes your responses to provide a

                Based on the outcome of the assessment, the system may also
                suggest appropriate drug prescriptions to assist in symptom
                relief or condition management. Please note that this tool is
                intended to offer initial insights and should not replace
                consultation with a qualified healthcare professional.
